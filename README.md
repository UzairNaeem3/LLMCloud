# LLMCloud
*********

This project aims to enable the deployment of open-source language models in the cloud, offering easy access via an API for integration into your applications. Users will also be able to test these models in real-time through an interactive web interface powered by Gradio. Additionally, the project plans to include Langchain for building sophisticated workflows and LlamaIndex for effective data indexing, which will allow seamless interactions with large datasets and model queries.
